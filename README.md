# Blockshift

## Project Description

Blockshift is a decentralised task management and reward system built on blockchain technology. It enables users to create tasks with cryptocurrency rewards, assign them to others, and automatically distribute payments upon completion. The platform leverages smart contracts to ensure transparent, trustless, and automated task completion verification and reward distribution.

The system eliminates the need for intermediaries in freelance work and task completion, providing a direct peer-to-peer platform where task creators can post jobs with ETH rewards, and workers can complete tasks to earn cryptocurrency rewards instantly upon verification.
